   abstract = {Machine learning (ML) has been increasingly used to aid aerodynamic shape optimization (ASO), thanks to the availability of aerodynamic data and continued developments in deep learning. We review the applications of ML in ASO to date and provide a perspective on the state-of-the-art and future directions. We first introduce conventional ASO and current challenges. Next, we introduce ML fundamentals and detail ML algorithms that have been successful in ASO. Then, we review ML applications to ASO addressing three aspects: compact geometric design space, fast aerodynamic analysis, and efficient optimization architecture. In addition to providing a comprehensive summary of the research, we comment on the practicality and effectiveness of the developed methods. We show how cutting-edge ML approaches can benefit ASO and address challenging demands, such as interactive design optimization. Practical large-scale design optimizations remain a challenge because of the high cost of ML training. Further research on coupling ML model construction with prior experience and knowledge, such as physics-informed ML, is recommended to solve large-scale ASO problems.},

@article{Kingma2013,
   abstract = {How can we perform efficient inference and learning in directed probabilistic models, in the presence of continuous latent variables with intractable posterior distributions, and large datasets? We introduce a stochastic variational inference and learning algorithm that scales to large datasets and, under some mild differentiability conditions, even works in the intractable case. Our contributions are two-fold. First, we show that a reparameterization of the variational lower bound yields a lower bound estimator that can be straightforwardly optimized using standard stochastic gradient methods. Second, we show that for i.i.d. datasets with continuous latent variables per datapoint, posterior inference can be made especially efficient by fitting an approximate inference model (also called a recognition model) to the intractable posterior using the proposed lower bound estimator. Theoretical advantages are reflected in experimental results.},

@article{Danhaive2022,
   abstract = {Designers increasingly rely on parametric design studies to explore and improve structural concepts based on quantifiable metrics, generally either by generating design variations manually or using optimization methods. Unfortunately, both of these approaches have important shortcomings: effectively searching a large design space manually is infeasible, and design optimization overlooks qualitative aspects important in architectural and structural design. There is a need for methods that take advantage of computing intelligence to augment a designer's creativity while guiding—not forcing—their search for better-performing solutions. This research addresses this need by integrating conditional variational autoencoders in a performance-driven design exploration framework. First, a sampling algorithm generates a dataset of meaningful design options from an unwieldy design space. Second, a performance-conditioned variational autoencoder with a low-dimensional latent space is trained using the collected data. This latent space is intuitive to explore by designers even as it offers a diversity of high-performing design options.},
